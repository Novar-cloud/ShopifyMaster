# Shopify Developer Portfolio - Deployment Instructions

This is a **production-ready** static version of your Shopify developer portfolio website.

## Deploying to Netlify

### Option 1: Direct Upload (Recommended)

1. Log in to your Netlify account
2. Click on "Sites" in the top navigation
3. **Drag and drop this entire folder** (netlify-ready) directly onto the Netlify UI where it says "Drag and drop your site folder here"
4. Your site will be deployed immediately - no build configuration needed!

### Important Notes

- This version is a complete, standalone static website with HTML and CSS in a single file
- The contact form is already configured to work with Netlify Forms
- No build steps are required - this completely bypasses any "Could not resolve entry module 'index.html'" errors

### Contact Form Configuration

The contact form is set up with:
- Netlify Forms integration (with the `data-netlify="true"` attribute)
- A hidden input to make form submissions work correctly
- All necessary fields that match your original design

## Need to Make Changes?

If you need to modify this static version:
1. Edit the `index.html` file directly
2. Make sure to keep the `data-netlify="true"` attribute on the form
3. Upload the folder again to Netlify
